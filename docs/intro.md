[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7102242.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7102242)

In this Jupyter book we will introduce you to the basics of image processing [Python](https://python.org/) and [Napari](https://napari.org/). The one-day course is focused on processing microscopy images showing cells and nuclei. We will dive through segmenting objects, measuring their properties, managing measurements in tables and plotting results.
